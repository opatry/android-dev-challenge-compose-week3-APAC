# Speed Run (APAC area) - Week #3

[![Workflow result](https://github.com/opatry/android-dev-challenge-compose-week3-APAC/workflows/Check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/opatry/android-dev-challenge-compose-week3-APAC/actions/workflows/Check.yaml)

## :scroll: Description

Implement the _Bloom_ mockup provided for [APAC friendly area](https://github.com/android/android-dev-challenge-compose/blob/assets/Bloom.zip).

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

Apply theming and metrics described in the linked `Bloom.pdf` document.

Few identified issues remains:
- card have their background drawn twice leading to "border" (semi alpha surface colors seems to be applied twice to card background somehow)
- plant list doesn't scroll properly when last item is partially visible (maybe missing padding with bottom nav)
- text fields while focus aren't really nice
- text button color in dark mode might not be correct
